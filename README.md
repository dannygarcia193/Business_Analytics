**Project Name:** Finding Marketing Investment Opportunities - Yandex.Afisha User Analysis

**Project description:** Hello this is my Business Analytics Project submission from Practicum by Yandex's Data Analyst program. You can find more about the Data Analyst by clicking [here.](https://practicum.yandex.com/data-analyst/)

The following "hypothetical" report pertains to Yandex.Afisha users in the United States. Here I put to work my analytical thinking as well as my coding, and business analyst skills to help the company (Yandex.Afisha) in their marketing strategy by analyzing their user's behavior. 


### 1. Summary of Project

> Most users seem to be the most active in terms of their session visit and spending behavior, during June to March with the majority accessing the site via their desktop device (70% of share). Over the years, total visit and revenue showed a slight increase in 2018. On the aggregate level, paying users mostly make their purchase from 11 am to 2pm of which buying count decrease over the next hours; this is followed by another wave of spending between 8 to 10 pm. Moreover, each of the visits have an average of around 5 minutes spent on the site with a one day average session per user.

> In terms of revenue, a given paying user will bring an average of $7.67 to the company over his/her average lifetime (estimated at 1 month). In addition, on a monthly basis there is an average of 2,808 unique active users of which make an aggregate of 3,874 purchases of around 1 purchase per user. It should be noted that, most of that revenue comes from returning users with lifetimes greater than one month as the churn rate within the first month is at a 95%. Lastly, it was shown that average user ROMI does not differ per marketing source--ROMI ranged from $.36 to $.41.


### 2. Conclusion

>  As an anlyst intern, this analysis provided the company with an overview of their user's visit and spending trends as well as their return on marketing investment (ROMI). In general, ROMI amongst the marketing sources was shown to be in the ranges of $0.36 to $0.43 per user with an average of 9 months till pay off. More focus should be placed on retaining early users given the high first month churn rate at an average of 95%. 

> A more in-depth analysis should be done to find who the returning customers are, what's causing the large churn rate, and how to improve acquisition given the small change in unique visits.
